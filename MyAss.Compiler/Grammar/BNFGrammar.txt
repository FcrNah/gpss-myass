
Rules of Thumb:
1. There is no difference between command and block right now, all are verbs;
2. Verb operator (if exits) is first operand;
3. Operands separated by Comma or Whitespace char;
	3.1 Despite of it spaces can be used inside parenthesized expressions, 
		'cos whitespaces are ignored inside parexpressions;
4. Suffix logic (Assign/Savevalue) fubars current grammatics, is not supported;
5. Issue with optional label solved with verb name lookup in Framework metadata;

BNF syntax description:
(...)	- grouping
[...]	- optional item
(...)*	- items repeating 0 or more times
(...)+	- items repeating 1 or more times
|		- choice operator


ID Types:
- Label
- VerbName
- Entity Instance Name
- Method (or SNA)
- Directive parameter


Thoughts:
1. External libraries imports
	1.1 Possibility to use qualified types like ThirdParty.Verbs.MyGenerate
	1.2 Add language directives like @using ThirdParty.Verbs
		1.2.1 This should be for Namespaces and Types also (for procedures)

2. SNA may not be wrapped in static methods, but just methods on the Entity;

3. Simulation object should not be singleton

4. Add logic to restrict duplicate labels
