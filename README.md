# gpss-myass

### How to build
Import solution to VS and build it. I've built it with Visual Studio 2017 recently.

### How to run sample model
Set **MyAss.Application** as StartUp project and run it.
You can change runnable model in *Runner* class manually.

### How to run tests
You would need to install "NUnit 2 Test Adapter" plugin to Visual Studio to run tests.

Please note that tests will fail under NUnit 3. This is a known issue.
